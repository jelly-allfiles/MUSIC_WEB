    <h1><em>Red Tracklist (2012)</em></h1>
    <p><em><b>Red</b></em>(occasionally stylized as RED) is the fourth studio album by American singer and songwriter Taylor Swift, 
        released on October 22, 2012, through Big Machine Records. The title is the color to which Swift associated 
        the tumultuous emotions she was experiencing from lost love while conceiving the album.</p>
    <p>Red was supported by a world tour, the Red Tour (2013-2014), and seven singles; <em><b>"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"</b></em> 
        peaked atop the US Billboard Hot 100. The first song that Swift wrote was <em><b>"All Too Well"</b></em>; during a February 2011 rehearsal 
        of the tour, she ad-libbed lyrics written after a broken relationship while playing a four-chord guitar riff as her touring 
        band spontaneously played backing instruments. She worked with Butch Walker on <em><b>"Everything Has Changed"</b></em>â€”a duet with the English 
        singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran. Swift traveled to Los Angeles to work with Martin and his frequent collaborator Shellback, 
        who produced the songs <em><b>"22"</b></em>.</p>

        <h1><em>1989 Tracklist (2014)</em></h1>
        <p><em><b>1989</b></em> is the fifth studio album by American singer and songwriter Taylor Swift, released on October 27, 2014, through Big Machine Records.</p>
        <p>1989's commercial success transformed Swift's image from a country singer-songwriter to a worldwide pop phenomenon. 
            The album was the second album to spawn five or more US top-10 singles in the 2010s decade, and made Swift the second 
            woman to have two albums each score five US top-10 hits. Its singles received heavy rotation on US radio over a year and 
            a half following its release, which Billboard described as "a kind of cultural omnipresence that's rare for a 2010s album".</p>
